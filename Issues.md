- Multilevel is a little (approximately 3 times) slower than normal ising...
- Multiple functions for frustration. Are they slow?
- Three types - majority, inhibition dominant and activation dominant
- For EMT_RACIPE without signals, multilevel formalism for level 1 fails to capture hybrid states. normal ising captures it fine.
